# Moore-Independent-Proposal

This is for my Independent Project.
<a href=https://canvas.jmu.edu/courses/1778526/assignments/13082022> Project Proposal </a>

<p>The project I would like to work on as my independent project is the app I created in SMAD 203, called “Valley BBQ”. This project would contain elements of UX Research and UX Design and Prototyping skills that I learned in SMAD 317. I would like to update the research, design, and prototype of Valley BBQ to make it look more real and introduce the high fidelity, full functional prototypes that I did not have the chance to create in 203. I would like to make sure that my Valley BBQ app is easy to understand and use, that users will have an enjoyable experiences while using the app, and that no one would feel put off or singled out by any of the terms (such as pronouns, assumptions concerning heteronormativity, etc.) The audience for the Valley BBQ app are people typically in the Harrisonburg, VA area but can extend to those in Charlottesville or nearby counties/cities or those visiting in Massanutten. Valley BBQ is specifically for those who like eating barbeque and are open to trying new restaurants in the Shenandoah Valley area. The recommended age range for those using Valley BBQ is 18 and up, however, it is not an “adult” site as preteens and teens can look at the app to determine if they would like to try a restaurant as well. As I already have the basic perimeters of this app, I would like to begin tweaking my research and begin my edits and functionalities of the app by next week (February 8th-12th). </p>
